🔧 Strong focus on writing **clean, scalable code** applying **SOLID principles**, **Clean Architecture**, and **TDD**  
🔹 Experience with **React.js, Next.js, TypeScript, Node.js, Python, PHP, React Native**  
🔹 Skilled in designing **robust APIs**, building **modern interfaces**, and implementing **backend services**

💡 I believe technology is a tool to solve problems — I enjoy crafting solutions that are reliable, simple, and built to last.
